## About
I'm active on the Rock Band's custom songs community since 2017, and I've created more than 30 songs for the game, with full band charts ready to be played on all available systems! Here, I'm saving all my REAPER and MAGMA projects for every song I've charted for the game. The DLC files can be found on C3 (the Customs Creators Collective).

These projects files is part of a "remastering" project, where I revise all charts, doing manual reductions, custom venues, and lipsync files.
