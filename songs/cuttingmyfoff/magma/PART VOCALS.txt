I found a pic- ture that we took and we brought in the new year
It's hard to see but I re- mem- ber
You wore a cock- tail dress
Ig- nored the goose bumps on your neck
The name sake of you out- fit to keep you warm
You al- ways said that ev- ery thought I had was ge- o- me- tric
I could- n't think out- side my own lines
I hope you're al- right and I'm sor- ry that I wast- ed your time
Nev- er had the in- ten- tion to make you go oh= + + ho
To make you go= ho
To make you go to make you go
I nev- er want- ed to make you go
And you might be a strang- er now
And I just want- ed to let you know
That I meant what I said
And ev- ery dream I've ev- er had's been of my- self
And ev- ery dream I've ev- er had's been of a
Bet- ter view with a ten month sum- mer
Los- ing you is like cut- ting my fing- ers off
And ev- en with that sum- mer
With- out you I'd rath- er cut my fin- gers off + +
