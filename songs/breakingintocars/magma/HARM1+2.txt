Can I beat 'em now Can I get your love
Can I beat 'em now Can I get your love
Don't you re- a- lize I long for your lips
Don't you re- a- lize I long for your lips
Let me out of here let me out of here
You drive me round and round + you drive me round and round +
Un- til I crash in- to + the stars
You take me for a spin + you take me for a spin +
Un- til I crash in- to + the stars
I'm break- ing in- to cars I'm break- ing in- to cars
Can I beat 'em now Can I get your love
Can I beat 'em now Can I get your love
You keep ig- nor- ing me and the tear- drops fall
You keep ig- nor- ing me and the tear- drops fall
Let me out of here let me out of here
You drive me round and round + you drive me round and round +
Un- til I crash in- to + the stars
You take me for a spin + you take me for a spin +
Un- til I crash in- to + the stars
I'm break- ing in- to cars I'm break- ing in- to cars
You drive me round and round + you drive me round and round +
Un- til I crash in- to + the stars
You take me for a spin + you take me for a spin +
Un- til I crash in- to + the stars
I'm break- ing in- to cars I'm break- ing in- to cars
