@Dead in the wa- + ter
@It's not a paid va- ca- tion
@The sons and daugh- ters of ci- ty of- fi- cials at- tend dem- on- stra- tions
@It's hard- ly a sink + or swim when all is well if the tick- et sells
@Out with a whim- per
@It's not a blaze for glo- + ry
@You look down from your tem- ple
@As peo- ple en- deav- or to make it a sto- + ry
@And chi- sel a mar- + ble word but all is lost if it's nev- er heard +
@But I've got some- one to make + re- ports +
@And^ tell + me how my mon- ey's spent
@To book my stays + and draw my blinds +
@So I^ can't tell what's real- ly there#
@And all I need's a great# big con- grat- u- la- + tions
@I'll keep your dreams +
@You pay at- ten- tion for me
@Strange as it seems + I'd# rath- er dis- solve than have you ig- nore + me
@The ground may be mov- + ing fast
@But I tied my boots to a bro- ken mast
@The dif- ference is clear +
@You throw it in your caul- dron
@Rust and ve- neer + dusk and dawn
@Stein- ways and Bald- + wins
@You start with a sim- ple stock of all the waste and salt to taste
@But damn my luck and damn these friends +
@That keep on comb- ing back their smiles
@I save my grace + with half= assed guilt +
@And lay# down# the quilt up- on the lawn +
@Spread my arms and soak# up con- grat- u- la- + tions
